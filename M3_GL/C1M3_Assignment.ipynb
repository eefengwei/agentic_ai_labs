    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools—such as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you’ll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML—laying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

      "### Overview of Radio Observations in Recurrent Novae\n",
      "\n",
      "Recurrent novae are a subclass of cataclysmic variable stars that undergo repeated nova outbursts, with intervals ranging from a few years to decades. These systems are composed of a white dwarf accreting material from a companion star, usually a red giant, leading to periodic thermonuclear explosions on the white dwarf's surface. Radio observations provide crucial insights into the dynamics and mechanisms of these explosive events, shedding light on the ejected mass, shock interactions, and circumstellar environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Studies and Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **V745 Scorpii and RS Ophiuchi**:\n",
      "   - A study documented radio observations at 610 and 235 MHz using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) of the recurrent nova V745 Scorpii, which had its last recorded outburst in February 2014. This work builds on previous observations of RS Ophiuchi, followed in detail during its 2006 outburst.\n",
      "   - The study noted that radio emissions appear sooner in successive outbursts within these novae, offering a nuanced understanding of their evolutionary behavior [Kamble et al., 2016, MNRAS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.456L..49K).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **T Pyxidis**:\n",
      "   - The 2011 outburst of the recurrent nova T Pyx was observed using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. These radio observations revealed significant details about the ejected mass and indicated complex mass loss mechanisms.\n",
      "   - The observations pointed towards the thermal emission consistent with the nova ejecta, helping to characterize the unique features of this prototypical, yet unusual, recurrent nova [Sokoloski & Mioduszewski, 2014, ApJ](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785...78N/abstract).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **RS Ophiuchi - 2021 Outburst**:\n",
      "   - The 2021 outburst of RS Ophiuchi was captured through low-frequency radio observations, adding another layer of understanding about this historically significant recurrent nova. These observations emphasized the lowest frequency detections made to date, contributing valuable data on shock interactions and non-thermal emission processes [Zhang et al., 2022, MNRAS](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/523/1/132/7159730).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Historical and Technical Insights**:\n",
      "   - RS Ophiuchi was notable for its first radio detection after an outburst, registering a brightness temperature well above typical classical novae, suggesting a significant non-thermal component in its emission [Bode et al., 1980s, Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/315306a0).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **General Observations of Classical Novae**:\n",
      "   - General radio studies since the 1970s have interpreted the radio signatures of novae primarily as thermal free–free emission, providing foundational knowledge that informs current research on both classical and recurrent novae [Seaquist et al. in IOP Science](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac24ab/pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio observations of recurrent novae like V745 Scorpii, RS Ophiuchi, and T Pyx are vital to understanding their explosive phenomena. They allow astronomers to trace ejecta evolution, explore interactions with the circumstellar medium, and analyze non-thermal emissions, giving rise to a comprehensive understanding of nova behavior and contributing to broader astrophysical models of cataclysmic systems.\n",

      "### Introduction\n",
      "Recurrent novae are binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf and a companion star. In these systems, nova eruptions occur repeatedly over time scales of decades. These outbursts are the result of material from the companion star accumulating on the surface of the white dwarf until nuclear fusion is reignited, causing a thermonuclear explosion. Radio observations are crucial in studying the mass outflows, ejecta structures, and their interaction with the surrounding medium.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Recurrent Novae - A Review**  \n",
      "   Koji Mukai (2014) presents an overview of the recurrent nova phenomena, emphasizing the importance of multi-wavelength observations, including radio, to understand the complex behavior of these systems, such as the well-known T Pyxidis (T Pyx) nova which has challenged models of cataclysmic variables and symbiotic stars [Link to full text](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4526v1).\n",

      "Radio observations have substantially advanced our understanding of recurrent novae, offering insights into the mass ejection processes, interaction with the interstellar environment, and potential for particle acceleration. Continued monitoring and enhanced radio facilities will likely unravel further complexities and inform models predicting their evolution and potential connections to supernovae. These insights are invaluable for piecing together the lifecycle of stellar systems and their contributions to galactic ecology.\n",

      "## Radio Observations of Recurrent Novae: An Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "### Introduction\n",
      "Recurrent novae are binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf and a companion star. In these systems, nova eruptions occur repeatedly over time scales of decades. These outbursts result from material from the companion star accumulating on the surface of the white dwarf until nuclear fusion is reignited, causing a thermonuclear explosion. Radio observations are crucial for studying mass outflows, ejecta structures, and their interactions with the surrounding medium, thereby enhancing our understanding of these complex astrophysical phenomena.\n",

      "### Key Studies and Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Recurrent Novae - A Review**  \n",
      "   Koji Mukai (2014) presents a comprehensive overview of the recurrent nova phenomena, emphasizing the importance of multi-wavelength observations, including radio, to understand the complex behavior of these systems. The review highlights the case of T Pyxidis (T Pyx), which has challenged existing models of cataclysmic variables and symbiotic stars. [Link to full text](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4526v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **The 2011 Outburst of Nova T Pyx**  \n",
      "   Radio observations of the 2011 outburst of T Pyx, conducted using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, revealed a high mass ejection that contrasts with typical recurrent novae profiles. The data suggest more massive ejecta than usual for recurrent novae, highlighting the complex dynamics of this particular system and its implications for theoretical models.
